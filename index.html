            "I have always had a knack for getting the best out of people, but I have never known why.
            That lack of understanding is what led me to learn as much as I could about what makes a leader."

            It started with a Challenge.
            When I was in my third year of employement, I was asked to to get 150 people trained on a new process with no instruction of how to complete the task.
            What made it worse was that I only had 2 hours left before I left on vacation for a week.
            In that moment I was humbled, frustrated, and thought there was no way I could possibly complete the task at hand.
            So I reached out for help.

            Through my conversations with my mentor I realised that it was not that I did not have the time or resources to train the team.
            It was that I was thinking I had to individually train the team.
            When I realised that I could disperse the work to be done across multiple team members I suddenly had a better plan that could be executed more quickly with more room for review and understanding.
            If I apply these same collaboration principles across other practices I can move faster through all of my work.

        <p>
            I love solving problems and found that coding coding be the perfect cross between problem solving and collaboration.
            This started started me on my journey to this point.
            My portfolio, this class, and these people.
            I want to understand how I can use my training for leadership to influence how I code and how I build effective teams to do great work.
